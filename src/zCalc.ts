  /* To understand what is done below we need to do some math. I hope the explanation is clear enough.
   * First of, the names will be shortened for ease of manipulation:
   * n:= targetMoney (n for new), o:= startMoney (o for old), b:= exponentialBase, t:= threadMultiplier, c:= cycles/threads
   * c is what we are trying to compute.
   *
   * After growing, the money on a server is n = (o + c) * b^(c*t)
   * c appears in an exponent and outside it, this is usually solved using the productLog/lambert's W special function
   * this function will be noted W in the following
   * The idea behind lambert's W function is W(x)*exp(W(x)) = x, or in other words, solving for y, y*exp(y) = x, as a function of x
   * This function is provided in some advanced math library but we will compute it ourself here.
   *
   * Let's get back to solving the equation. It cannot be rewrote using W immediately because the base of the exponentiation is b
   * b^(c*t) = exp(ln(b)*c*t) (this is how a^b is defined on reals, it matches the definition on integers)
   * so n = (o + c) * exp(ln(b)*c*t) , W still cannot be used directly. We want to eliminate the other terms in 'o + c' and 'ln(b)*c*t'.
   *
   * A change of variable will do. The idea is to add an equation introducing a new variable (w here) in the form c = f(w) (for some f)
   * With this equation we will eliminate all references to c, then solve for w and plug the result in the new equation to get c.
   * The change of variable performed here should get rid of the unwanted terms mentioned above, c = w/(ln(b)*t) - o should help.
   * This change of variable is allowed because whatever the value of c is, there is a value of w such that this equation holds:
   * w = (c + o)*ln(b)*t  (see how we used the terms we wanted to eliminate in order to build this variable change)
   *
   * We get n = (o + w/(ln(b)*t) - o) * exp(ln(b)*(w/(ln(b)*t) - o)*t) [ = w/(ln(b)*t) * exp(w - ln(b)*o*t) ]
   * The change of variable exposed exp(w - o*ln(b)*t), we can rewrite that with exp(a - b) = exp(a)/exp(b) to isolate 'w*exp(w)'
   * n = w/(ln(b)*t) * exp(w)/exp(ln(b)*o*t) [ = w*exp(w) / (ln(b) * t * b^(o*t)) ]
   * Almost there, we just need to cancel the denominator on the right side of the equation:
   * n * ln(b) * t * b^(o*t) = w*exp(w), Thus w = W(n * ln(b) * t * b^(o*t))
   * Finally we invert the variable change: c = W(n * ln(b) * t * b^(o*t))/(ln(b)*t) - o
   *
   * There is still an issue left: b^(o*t) doesn't fit inside a double precision float
   * because the typical amount of money on servers is around 10^6~10^9
   * We need to get an approximation of W without computing the power when o is huge
   * Thankfully an approximation giving ~30% error uses log immediately so we will use
   * W(n * ln(b) * t * b^(o*t)) ~= log(n * ln(b) * t * b^(o*t)) = log(n * ln(b) * t) + log(exp(ln(b) * o * t))
   * = log(n * ln(b) * t) + ln(b) * o * t
   * (thanks to Drak for the grow formula, f4113nb34st and Wolfram Alpha for the rewrite, dwRchyngqxs for the explanation)

  /* Iterative refinement, the goal is to correct c until |(o + c) * b^(c*t) - n| < 1
   * or the correction on the approximation is less than 1
   * The Newton-Raphson method will be used, this method is a classic to find roots of functions
   * (given f, find c such that f(c) = 0).
   *
   * The idea of this method is to take the horizontal position at which the horizontal axis
   * intersects with of the tangent of the function's curve as the next approximation.
   * It is equivalent to treating the curve as a line (it is called a first order approximation)
   * If the current approximation is c then the new approximated value is c - f(c)/f'(c)
   * (where f' is the derivative of f).
   *
   * In our case f(c) = (o + c) * b^(c*t) - n, f'(c) = d((o + c) * b^(c*t) - n)/dc
   * = (ln(b)*t * (c + o) + 1) * b^(c*t)
   * And the update step is c[new] = c[old] - ((o + c) * b^(c*t) - n)/((ln(b)*t * (o + c) + 1) * b^(c*t))
   *
   * The main question to ask when using this method is "does it converges?"
   * (are the approximations getting better?), if it does then it does quickly.
   * DOES IT CONVERGES? In the present case it does. The reason why doesn't help explaining the algorithm.
   * If you are interested then check out the wikipedia page.
